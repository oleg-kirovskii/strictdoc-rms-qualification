Perfect — I’ll build the table with four columns:

1. **Requirement number**
2. **Requirement text**
3. **Requirement characteristic** — either *Fully compliant* or *Not compliant to at least one attribute*
4. **ISO/IEC TR 24766:2009 Chapter/Clause** where the requirement originates

Because we have 86 requirements, the table will be long, but still structured clearly.
